    "text": "Visualizing the Data\nIn all four regions, there is a positive association between cancer prevalence and routine checkup prevalence, reflecting improved cancer detection in areas with better healthcare access. However, disparities emerge, as the South and Midwest exhibit slightly lower mean cancer prevalence than the East and West Coasts despite similar trends. The color gradient highlights areas with lower health insurance prevalence, emphasizing its impact on regional variation by restricting access to routine checkups and reducing early cancer detection rates. The South has noticeably more yellow dots than other regions, indicating higher levels of uninsured individuals. The cluster of yellow dots in the South corresponds to Texas, as shown in the maps below.\nTable 1: Average checkup prevalence, lack of health insurance rates, and cancer prevalence by U.S. region. Data are sourced from the 2024 PLACES Census Tract dataset. Values are averaged within regions and presented as percentages, rounded to two decimal places for clarity. Sample size covers all US census tracts.\nThe table highlights regional disparities in health measures across the United States. The East Coast leads in average checkup prevalence (78.32%) and has the lowest average lack of health insurance (8.34%), suggesting better access to preventative care and healthcare services. In contrast, the South has the highest rate of uninsured individuals (15.07%) but relatively high checkup prevalence (76.92%), indicating that while many residents prioritize health checkups, systemic issues like lower income levels or gaps in healthcare expansion may limit insurance coverage. While cancer prevalence is similar across all the regions, the Midwest shows the highest average (8.28%), potentially linked to demographic factors such as an aging population or higher prevalence of cancer risk behaviors like smoking. The West Coast, with the lowest cancer prevalence (7.55%), might benefit from healthier lifestyles and policies supporting preventive care. These trends underline the influence of socioeconomic, behavioral, and policy-driven factors on regional health outcomes.\nThe plots illustrate a negative association between housing insecurity and cancer prevalence, suggesting that individuals in higher housing-insecure areas may face barriers to healthcare and cancer diagnosis. Food insecurity, represented by the blue to yellow color gradient, is generally higher in areas with greater housing insecurity, exacerbating disparities. This trend suggests that individuals in areas with greater housing insecurity face barriers to accessing healthcare or diagnosis. These findings align with research showing that about 16.6% of cancer survivors had moderate to increased level of housing insecurity, which can further emphasize health inequities 2.\nThe graph indicates a positive association between the lack of health insurance and housing insecurity, suggesting that individuals without health insurance are more likely to experience housing insecurity. This trend highlights the interconnectedness of socioeconomic factors that may indirectly contribute to cancer prevalence, as both housing insecurity and lack of health insurance are known barriers to accessing preventative care and timely cancer diagnoses 3. The widening spread of housing insecurity at higher levels of uninsured populations suggests regional or systemic disparities that could worsen health inequities.\nIn this graph, a few previous correlations are reiterated. The box plots show a steady increase in prevalence of cancer as lack of health insurance decreases. As before, we interpret this as meaning that the variable representing prevalence of cancer in our data set would more accurately be described as representing prevalence of detected cancer, while, for people without health insurance, cancer is less likely to be discovered before it is too late. Likewise, prevalence of health checkups appears to be positively correlated with access to health insurance, and thus to prevalence of cancer.\nHowever, it would be easy to conclude from that information alone that there exists a causal relationship between lower income groups without health insurance, regular checkups, and cancer; this plot separates the individual points, which now represent counties, so that the variation in each health insurance category is clear. In fact, the scatter plot allows us to see that there are some outliers in the 8 - 11 and 11 - 15 percent groups with higher prevalences of cancer than the group with the most access to health insurance, illustrating that this is a complex issue, of which we are only observing two dimensions. We approach the question in this way because we would like to avoid deficit thinking.\nA map of lack of health insurance by contiguous U.S. county mostly highlights how extreme Southern and Eastern Texan counties are. Variation among other regions is more difficult to identify. Thus, we also provide a map with Texas removed.\nNow, it is evident that the Northeastern United States, as well as some counties on the West coast, have the highest access to health insurance. According to our previous plots, the other regions identified in these two maps likely have the greatest prevalence of undetected cancer instances. Keeping Texas in mind, there are a few potential factors that might be related to the geographical distribution we observe: migration, political leaning, and broad population density all exhibit trends that could be identified as similar to this one. On the other hand, without examining these variables alongside our data, county-by-county, it is impossible to say what factors are truly influential on this variation."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis project highlights the significant regional disparities in health outcomes across the United States, focusing on cancer prevalence, healthcare access, and socioeconomic factors such as housing and food insecurity. Through the analysis of PLACES Census Tract Data, we observed varying relationships between health indicators, including a negative correlation between housing insecurity and cancer prevalence. These trends suggest that regions with higher levels of housing insecurity may face barriers to healthcare access, potentially leading to undetected cancer cases. Furthermore, a positive association between lack of health insurance and housing insecurity reinforces the interconnectedness of socioeconomic factors that contribute to health disparities.\nThe geographic maps further illustrated the extreme lack of health insurance in areas like the Texas, where access to care is particularly limited. This reinforces the need for targeted policy interventions in regions with high uninsured populations, particularly in the South and West, where lack of health insurance is more prevalent. Still, the data shows a high level of variation alongside the strong trends that are present, so such policies would ideally be implemented on a granular level that meets the needs of specific communities.\nUltimately, this project emphasizes the critical role of socioeconomic factors in shaping health outcomes, with access to healthcare services, housing, and food security directly influencing cancer prevalence and detection. Addressing these disparities requires comprehensive policy solutions that not only focus on healthcare access but also tackle underlying socioeconomic inequalities that disproportionately affect vulnerable populations 4."

    "text": "Hospital Care Spending\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Per capita hospital care spending in 1991 across the United States.\n\n\n\n\nHospital care represents the largest single category of health spending, and its distribution across the United States has changed over the past three decades. In 1991, per capita hospital spending was relatively uniform, with most states clustered in a narrow range. Using a logarithmic scale allows small differences to be visible, revealing slightly higher spending in states such as Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, and slightly lower spending in states including Utah, Idaho, and Washington (Figure 1). This pattern indicates that at the start of the 1990s, geographic differences in hospital costs were modest, suggesting limited variation in the underlying drivers of hospital expenditures at the state level.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Per capita hospital care spending in 2020 across the United States.\n\n\n\n\nBy 2020, spending had increased in every state and regional patterns became more pronounced. Higher spending persisted in the Northeast and parts of the West, while previously lower-spending states experienced faster growth, reducing some relative differences but accentuating the concentration of high costs in specific areas (Figure 2). Comparing 1991 and 2020 highlights both the growth in hospital spending and the emergence of distinct geographic clusters of higher and lower expenditure. This change suggests that state-specific factors, such as demographics, healthcare infrastructure, and policy interventions, increasingly influenced spending patterns over time.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Interactive map showing 2020 hospital spending and average annual percent growth by state.\n\n\nThe interactive map adds further context by incorporating the average annual growth rate (AAG) alongside 2020 spending (Figure 3). States with lower initial spending often exhibit higher growth rates, approaching national averages, while historically higher-spending states show moderate growth. This combination of final spending and growth rate allows identification of states that experienced the most dynamic changes over three decades. Observing these patterns helps frame subsequent analysis of how Medicaid expansion may have contributed to shifts in hospital expenditures, as states with rapid growth may overlap with expansion decisions or timing."

    "text": "How has the expansion of Medicaid affected hospital spending?\nThe Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, implemented in 2014, extended coverage to adults with incomes up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level. This policy created substantial variation in state-level coverage and hospital demand.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. States classified by Medicaid expansion decision.\n\n\n\n\nThe static map of expansion decisions illustrates which states adopted the policy and which did not (Figure 4). Expansion is concentrated in the West, Northeast, and parts of the Midwest, while non-expansion states are largely in the South and central regions. The clear regional divide suggests that political, economic, and demographic factors influenced adoption.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Interactive map showing Medicaid expansion adoption by year for each state.\n\n\nThe interactive map shows the timing of Medicaid expansion adoption for each state (Figure 5). Early adoption occurred primarily in the West and Northeast, whereas later adoption is scattered across other regions. Combining this temporal information with hospital spending growth reveals patterns suggesting that earlier expansion may have contributed to higher growth in hospital costs, as coverage expansion increases utilization and shifts the mix of care paid by hospitals and insurers. States that delayed or declined expansion tend to exhibit lower growth trajectories, indicating that policy timing influenced expenditure dynamics alongside other economic and demographic factors.\nOverall, the maps suggest that Medicaid expansion contributed to variation in hospital spending across states, both in level and growth. Early-adopting states appear to show stronger increases in per capita hospital expenditures, while non-expansion states maintain relatively lower spending. This highlights the interplay between policy decisions and healthcare spending trends, demonstrating how federal and state policies interact with preexisting patterns to shape cost growth."

The combination of static and interactive visualizations illustrates how baseline spending, growth trajectories, and policy choices such as Medicaid expansion interact to influence per capita hospital costs. Early adoption of Medicaid expansion aligns with faster spending growth in several states, while states that delayed or declined expansion show slower increases.

    "text": "Sentiment by Section\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage sentiment of words in Guardian articles by section.\n\n\n\n\nThe sentiment analysis by section highlights variation in tone across Guardian coverage. Sport and Culture are the only two sections with predominantly positive sentiment. In contrast, Opinion, News, Business, and World news carry increasingly negative sentiment, with World news being the most negative overall. This distribution suggests that sections emphasizing commentary, current events, and financial coverage rely on more critical or pessimistic language, while of Culture and Sports coverage tend to adopt more neutral or favorable wording.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ten most frequent non-stopwords in each major Guardian section\n\n\n\n\nThe frequency analysis of top words by section further illustrates the thematic divides in coverage. Each section is defined by its own vocabulary, reflecting the issues and events that dominate that area of reporting. The prominence of certain recurring terms underscores how language choices shape tone and focus across sections. When considered alongside the sentiment analysis, the word frequency plot reinforces the idea that subject matter is closely tied to the tone conveyed, with structural differences in reporting leading to differences in sentiment.\nTogether, frequency, sentiment, and section analysis illustrate the interaction between content volume, language, and tone across Guardian coverage."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis project shows how text analysis can reveal both the dominant topics and the tone of media coverage. Across 2016–2021, headline language tracked major world events such as Brexit, the Trump presidency, and the COVID-19 pandemic, with shifts in word frequency aligning closely with the timing of these developments. By removing common words and focusing on more meaningful terms, the analysis highlighted how global crises and political figures shaped headline priorities, while output differences between sections revealed the Guardian’s emphasis on current events and international reporting.\nSentiment and section-level analysis added another layer of interpretation, showing that Sport and Culture coverage leaned more positive, while Opinion, News, Business, and World news sections carried a more negative tone. The top words in each section further reflected these divides, illustrating how language and sentiment interact with subject matter."
